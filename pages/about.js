        Hi, I'm Katherine! I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for developing web and
        mobile applications. I always knew I wanted to spend my time solving complex problems, and
        got a degree in Industrial Engineering from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

        About a year after graduating, I decided to dive headfirst into software development, and
        enrolled in an immersive coding bootcamp at Fullstack Academy. Through this program I
        discovered a love for using software to solve problems and make peoples lives easier.
